Yum! More LogMaster stuff! It took me so long to type up that thousand-long array with every number from 1 to 1000... just kidding, I did it in excel. It's actually a really cool trick. you do " for a column, then a, then ", then ,, then ", etc, and you do a couple rows like that and then drag it down.
Also, fixed a bug where players could sell shares at any time. =)

Everything for hand is working perfectly, except that squaresHeld isn't filling properly, or it is, but not at some parts? It fills the HandPanel just fine, but then only half of the squares at the most get highlighted, and only the highlighted squares can be placed. So, somehow, half or more of the values in squaresHeld is dissapearing.

Syntax changes

Revision 1.69  2007/04/26 01:06:02  Colin
-Reworked the code for updateMajorityHolders() to the point of unrecognizability. It works completely now, and is much cleaner and efficient.
-Added a restriction to buying shares so that the company has to be active to buy shares. Changed the warning message that asked players if "they really wanted to end their turn without buying shares" so it does not show if no shares are available.

Fixed duplicate computer names.

Revision 1.65  2007/04/24 16:35:43  Colin
I attempted to implement a system of displaying the majority and minority leaders. I added get and set methods for is<comp>Majority/MinorityHolder bools in player. then, I added to the updateMajMinHolders in company, so that it sets these bools in player. PlayerSetupPanel checks whether myPlayer is the majority or minority holder of anything, and appends a (+) or (-) to the end of the number of shares.
It doesn't work. I didn't extensively test, but I think the problem might lie in the system of determining the majority and minority leaders.

Revision 1.64  2007/04/23 23:52:02  Mike Lebson

Added key listeners for the endTurnButton in AcquireFrame and the goButton in the AcquireSetupFrame.
The key for ETB is the space bar, the key for the GB is the enter.
Focus automatically transfers to these buttons at the approprate times.
**NOTE** AcquireSetupFrame moved from generated to manual editing. I figured that we won't be doing anything really major anyone, so we can just do it manually. Colin, if you can get it to work again, go for it.

Revision 1.56  2007/03/27 13:41:23  Mike Lebson

Revision 1.30  2007/02/14 04:58:36  Colin
-Whew! Made a whole bunch of changes. First and foremost, I added the AcquireSetupFrame class (and the PlayerSetupPanel, which it uses), which is a much more efficient way to start a game. Try it out, it should be intuitive. I commented out all the code in GridPanel that was creating the game, just for now. There are only a couple more things to do - set the big toggle buttons to have some sort of picture, add more info on the setup sheet, have options, etc. Myles, your network stuff should work right into that class, or at least a class owned by it.
-I also started getting rid of the two-player sentiment that was used for testing, and making the game streamlined and efficient. More has to be done to this effect. Also, more work has to be done on the Game class and having it work with the GridPanel so that it really guides the player along and doesn't let him cheat.
